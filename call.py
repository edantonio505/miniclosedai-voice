"""call.py — FastRTC handler for the "call the bot" mode.

A long-running WebRTC peer connection with VAD-based turn detection. On each
detected pause we transcribe the buffered audio, POST it to MiniClosedAI's
existing chat-streaming endpoint, and feed the reply to Piper — **one
sentence at a time** so the user starts hearing audio while the rest of the
reply is still generating.

Pipeline per turn:

    audio (since the last pause)  →  faster-whisper ASR                →  text
                                                                          ↓
    text  →  POST /api/conversations/{id}/chat/stream  (to MiniClosedAI)
                                                                          ↓
    chunked reply  →  sentence splitter  →  Piper TTS (per sentence)   →  audio frames
                          (text events ride in parallel via DataChannel queue)

Side-channel events (each `AdditionalOutputs({...})`) the browser renders:
  {status: 'transcribing'|'thinking'|'speaking'|'listening'}  — pipeline stage
  {transcript: "..."}                                          — user's text
  {chunk: "..."}                                               — assistant token
  {end: true}                                                  — turn finished
  {error: "..."}                                               — pipeline failure

FastRTC's ReplyOnPause class already handles barge-in: when the user starts
speaking during a yielded TTS stream, the handler's generator is cancelled
and the next utterance starts a fresh turn.
